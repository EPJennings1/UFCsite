                        The UFC began as an idea developed by Art Davie, a businessman interested
                        in staging a real contest between different martial arts disciplines. He 
                        partnered with Rorion Gracie, a co-founder of Gracie Jiu-Jitsu, and Robert
                        Meyrowitz, head of Semaphore Entertainment Group (SEG). Their goal was to
                        create a tournament that would showcase the most effective martial art in 
                        real combat.The result was UFC 1, held on November 12, 1993, in 
                        Denver, Colorado. The event featured minimal rules, no weight classes, 
                        and fighters from various backgrounds. Royce Gracie’s early dominance 
                        introduced Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu to a global audience and shaped the foundations
                        of MMA.

                        Following its debut, the UFC quickly grew in popularity but also attracted
                        criticism due to its violent presentation. Politicians such as Senator John
                        McCain openly opposed the events, calling them “human cockfighting.”
                        Under increasing pressure, many states banned the UFC, and cable companies
                        dropped pay-per-view support. During this period, SEG attempted to rebrand
                        the sport by adding rules, weight classes, and rounds. Despite these 
                        efforts, financial instability grew, putting the future of the organization
                        at risk.

                        A pivotal moment came in 2005 with the debut of The Ultimate Fighter on
                        Spike TV. The season’s finale, featuring Forrest Griffin vs. Stephan 
                        Bonnar, is widely credited with catapulting the UFC into mainstream 
                        popularity.Throughout this period, major stars such as Chuck Liddell,

                        Brock Lesnar, and Jon Jones helped fuel rapid growth. The UFC expanded
